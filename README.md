## Getting started

First of all: clone this repository to your development environment. Doh!

	$ git clone https://github.com/rvantonisse/HTML5-Grunt-project-template.git

If you like this project, watch it, stargaze it, fork it, like it more and start making your own branches with it! =D

Make sure you have [installed node and grunt-cli](#Dependencies) before you continue. If all is well, open up your command line interface and set-up your project environment:

	$ npm install

Start developing with grunt:

	$ grunt

You are now ready to make changes to your new project. Well done!
